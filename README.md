# Graphical-DBMS
This project aims to solve the problem of looking at and analyzing data and working on data separately by incorporating Neo4j Graphical DBMS as API in Python with a rough example of a banking system and basic UI to retrieve data from the DB via the API.

Regular tabular databases are efficient to work in however tough to completely grasp and visualize information from. In this work, the focus was on solving this issue by incorporating a Graphical DBMS platform Neo4j which allows Node and Edge Graph type representation of data with edges being the Relationships between the datasets. Further by application of its native language Cypher we may work upon this Graph to get desired information of the User and the Bank associated with. A python code is proposed which utilizes API of Neo4j and incorporates a  GUI returning the outputs required fetched from the DB.

This work is directly inspired from my internship experience at Synergy Pvt. Ltd. , and also has a poster attached for a quick synopsis if you would be kind enough to look at it.
